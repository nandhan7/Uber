# Ride Booking Application Overview

This is a Ride Sharing application designed to facilitate users in booking rides, tracking their rides in real-time, and ensuring smooth communication with captains. The application is built with various features for both users and captains, making it easier for both parties to interact efficiently. Key features include:

## User Features

*   **User Registration & Authentication:** Users can register and log in with email and password. The app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
*   **Ride Booking:** Users can book rides by entering their pickup location and destination. Users can select the vehicle type (e.g., car, auto, motorcycle) while booking.
*   **OTP Verification:** Upon booking, users are sent an OTP (One-Time Password) for verifying their phone number to complete the booking.
*   **Ride Tracking:** Users can track their ride in real-time using Google Maps API to see the live location of the assigned captain. The application provides real-time updates on the ride's status (e.g., in transit, arrived).

## Captain Features

*   **Captain Registration & Authentication:** Captains can register and log in to the app, after which they can access their profiles and available rides. Captains also authenticate with JWT tokens.
*   **Ride Acceptance:** Captains can accept or decline incoming ride requests. Once a ride is accepted, the captain is assigned the userâ€™s pickup location and destination.
*   **Ride Updates:** Captains can update the ride status as they proceed (e.g., on the way, arrived, completed). Captains have access to real-time navigation for optimal routes via the Google Maps API.
*   **Real-Time Communication:** Captains and users can communicate directly via the app with sockets (real-time messaging) to discuss ride-related details.

## Real-Time Communication via Sockets

*   **Real-Time Ride Tracking:** As users track their ride, real-time updates are sent through sockets.
*   **Ride Notifications:** Socket-based notifications are used to inform users and captains of important events (e.g., ride requests, ride acceptance, ride arrival).

## Google Maps API Integration

*   **Route Optimization:** Both users and captains benefit from the Google Maps API for optimizing routes and minimizing travel time.
*   **Real-Time Location:** The application tracks and updates the location of both the user and captain throughout the ride.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB for database management.
*   **Frontend:** React.js for a seamless user interface.
*   **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO for efficient and scalable real-time communication.
*   **Map Integration:** Google Maps API for route planning and live tracking.
*   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for both users and captains.

This app enables users and captains to have a seamless ride-sharing experience, with features like ride booking, real-time tracking, and efficient communication through modern technologies and APIs. The system is designed to scale, ensuring smooth operations even during high-demand periods.
